# Pre-Launch Report — Opsfield Systems (Этап 13 Part A)

**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Scope:** Zero-budget pre-launch verification per development-plan.md → Этап 13 Part A.
**Build:** Next.js 16.2.9 (Turbopack), production build, default env (**preview mode**).

## Status: ✅ READY FOR PRE-LAUNCH REVIEW

Internal pre-launch asset (not commercial production). No code defects found; no fixes required. Commercial production remains gated on the documented items below (domain, email, legal providers, real form API) — as designed in development-plan.md.

---

## 1. Build & automated checks

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run check` (lint + tsc + build) | ✅ pass |
| `npm run test` — contracts | ✅ **30 passed**, 0 failed, 0 skipped |
| `npm run test` — e2e | ✅ **21 passed**, 0 failed, 0 skipped |

## 2. Preview isolation — ✅

- `/robots.txt` → `User-Agent: *` / `Disallow: /` (no sitemap).
- `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` on `/`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-use`, `/cookie-policy`.
- Homepage `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`.
- No GA4 measurement ID, no `gtag`, no `googletagmanager` in any built HTML.
- No `[production-domain]` placeholder anywhere.
- Homepage contains no `opsfieldsystems.com`. *(Legal pages do — see Known limitations.)*

## 3. All 11 sections — ✅

Count = 11; order exactly matches sitemap.md:
`hero → problem-section → what-we-diagnose → ai-process-automation → how-the-diagnostic-works → proof-examples → why-opsfield-systems → delivery-model → business-it-diagnostic → faq → final-cta`. Exactly one `<h1>`.

## 4. CTAs — ✅

All in-page anchors resolve (contract test), and scroll behavior verified by E2E:
- Hero primary "Request a Business & IT Diagnostic" → `#diagnostic-request-form` ✅
- Hero secondary "See How the Diagnostic Works" → `#how-the-diagnostic-works` ✅
- Header "Request Diagnostic" → `#diagnostic-request-form` ✅
- Footer CTA "Request a Diagnostic" → `#diagnostic-request-form` ✅
- Final CTA primary → `#diagnostic-request-form`, secondary → `#how-the-diagnostic-works` ✅
- Section CTAs all target one of the two anchors; all resolve.

## 5. Form — ✅ (delivery not testable — see limitations)

4 required fields visible; optional fields hidden by default; submit without optional fields works; CTA routing prefills request type; privacy notice links `/privacy-policy`; validation for empty fields (focus first invalid) and invalid email; loading shows "Submitting…"; success/error terminal states; duplicate submit prevented. All verified by the E2E form + cta-routing suites. **Submission is currently simulated** (no `/api/submit`/Resend wiring), so real email delivery is not testable.

## 6. Legal pages — ✅

`/privacy-policy` (38.7 KB), `/terms-of-use` (36.0 KB), `/cookie-policy` (29.7 KB) each render fully with exactly one `<h1>` and a working "Back to Home" link. Cross-links (Privacy↔Cookie) and footer legal links resolve (contract + E2E).

## 7. Header / Footer — ✅

- Header nav: Services, How It Works, Results, FAQ, + "Request Diagnostic" CTA — all resolve.
- Footer: Company (Team→#delivery-model, Services, Results, Contact), Get Started, Legal — all present/resolve.
- Copyright exact: `© 2026 Opsfield Systems. California, USA.`

## 8. Mobile (375×812) — ✅ (visual = owner QA)

Drawer opens/closes, closes on Escape with focus return, drawer link navigates + closes (E2E). No horizontal scroll (`overflow-x: clip`, no fixed `px` widths). Form usable. Touch targets ≥44px in CSS (buttons, nav, drawer, footer links, FAQ triggers, inputs, back-link). Pixel-level visual pass is owner QA.

## 9. Content integrity — ✅

- No `Clearpath` / old brand references.
- No `TODO`/`TBD`/`FIXME`/`lorem ipsum`.
- No `[production-domain]`.
- No fake logos, metrics, testimonials, or awards (site has none; scenarios are labeled anonymized/illustrative).
- **"immigration"** appears **once**, in the Privacy Policy's "do not submit … immigration documents" sensitive-data clause (verbatim approved texts.md). This is a standard privacy clause, **not** an O-1/immigration-service reference — compliant with the O-1 exclusion rule. No O-1/visa/petition service references anywhere.

## 10. Consent & analytics — ✅

Cookie consent banner does not appear (`ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false` → `CookieConsent` renders null; reopener null). No analytics scripts in page source. Site is fully functional without analytics. `trackEvent` call-sites are wired but no-op (all gates closed).

---

## Defects found & fixed

**None.** No genuine code defects surfaced in this pass.

## Defects found & NOT fixed

**None** (code). The items below are pre-production gate items, not code defects.

## Known limitations for production (gated — not code defects)

1. **Domain / canonical:** JSON-LD, canonical, OG use the preview host (`localhost` in this build). Set `SITE_URL` + `SITE_MODE=production` once the real domain is registered.
2. **Email placeholders:** legal pages render `privacy@opsfieldsystems.com` (verbatim approved texts.md), and the form's error-state fallback references `general@opsfieldsystems.com` (renders only in the error branch, not in default HTML). Both are placeholders pending domain/inbox confirmation (brand launch gate). Not changeable here without editing approved copy.
3. **Legal provider text:** Privacy/Cookie policies name **Netlify / Cloudflare / GA4**, while the actual stack is **Vercel / Resend**. Requires a texts.md content update for counsel before production.
4. **Form API:** submission is simulated; the real `/api/submit` + Resend integration and `RESEND_API_KEY` are not wired — email delivery is untestable until implemented.
5. **OG image:** dynamic placeholder — replace with an approved brand asset before production.

## Manual QA remaining for owner

- **Lighthouse** (Chrome, production build): Perf ≥90 desktop / ≥85 mobile, A11y ≥95, Best Practices ≥95, SEO ≥95.
- **axe** re-scan — currently blocked locally by a Chrome 149 / ChromeDriver 150 mismatch; run `npx browser-driver-manager install chrome` then re-scan.
- **200% / 400% zoom** reflow; **320 / 375 px** visual check.
- **Screen readers:** VoiceOver / NVDA.
- **Cross-browser:** Firefox + WebKit (add to `playwright.config.ts` projects for a local run).
- **iOS Safari** (if a device is available).
- **Real form submission** once the API key + `/api/submit` are wired.
- Owner to manually review every CTA and all visible copy.
