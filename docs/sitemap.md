# Sitemap

## Source of Truth

`sitemap.md` is the source of truth for page inventory, section order, URLs, anchors, navigation, internal-link targets, and indexation. `texts.md` is the source of truth for publishable copy, metadata, CTA labels, form labels, and legal text.

Final project files:

- `texts.md`
- `sitemap.md`
- `design.md`
- `optimization.md`

**Brand:** Opsfield Systems  
**Brand status:** Working brand; production launch is blocked until trademark clearance, California legal-entity / DBA mapping, and final domain ownership are confirmed.  
**Page:** Diagnostic-First IT & Business Development

## Структура страниц — MVP

| URL | Page | Type | Index / Noindex | Source file |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | Diagnostic-First IT & Business Development | Commercial landing page | Index | `texts.md` |
| `/privacy-policy` | Privacy Policy | Legal | Noindex | `texts.md` |
| `/terms-of-use` | Terms of Use | Legal | Noindex | `texts.md` |
| `/cookie-policy` | Cookie Policy | Legal | Noindex | `texts.md` |
| `/404` | Page Not Found | Utility | Noindex | (custom via app/not-found.tsx) |

### MVP rule

The MVP commercial page is one landing page with **11 top-level visual sections**. Its section order must match `texts.md` exactly.

The Business & IT Diagnostic section is one composite conversion section. `Before You Commit`, `What Happens After You Submit the Request`, and the Diagnostic Request Form are sub-blocks inside it, not separate full-width sections. The form keeps the nested target `#diagnostic-request-form` for CTA routing.

### Business & IT Diagnostic — sub-block order

| # | Sub-block | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Offer | H2, text, output, primary CTA |
| 2 | Before You Commit | Review assets, access rule, privacy note |
| 3 | What Happens After You Submit | 3-step post-submit flow |
| 4 | Diagnostic Request Form | #diagnostic-request-form |

Sub-blocks share one section background and one conversion narrative.
Do not reorder sub-blocks independently of this sequence.

### Brand and domain launch gate

- `Opsfield Systems` remains the working brand across copy, design, and development files.
- Working-brand use is not a legal clearance opinion and does not establish trademark availability.
- Do not display `LLC`, `Inc.`, `®`, or another legal identifier until the legal operator and registration status are verified.
- Keep production domain and email addresses as placeholders until the domain is registered in a business-controlled account.
- Production launch is blocked until evidence of trademark review, California entity / DBA mapping, domain ownership, and approved operator name is archived.

Domain pre-purchase is operationally separate from trademark clearance. Securing the domain early ($10–15) reduces the risk of third-party registration during the review period. If the brand changes, the domain cost is negligible. If the domain is lost, recovery cost is significantly higher.

## Landing page — sections from `texts.md`

| # | Section from `texts.md` | Anchor ID | Purpose |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hero | `#hero` | Позиционирование, основной ICP 50–250 employees, главный оффер, primary / secondary CTA и trust line. |
| 2 | Problem Section | `#problem-section` | Объясняет, что проблема клиента часто не в технологии, а в процессах, данных, ownership и системах. |
| 3 | What We Diagnose | `#what-we-diagnose` | Показывает диагностируемые зоны: processes, CRM / RevOps, data, dashboards, integrations, automation, AI readiness, IT risk. |
| 4 | AI & Process Automation | `#ai-process-automation` | Показывает второй сервис как продолжение диагностики, roadmap и limited implementation. |
| 5 | How the Diagnostic Works | `#how-the-diagnostic-works` | Объясняет метод: review → map → score → recommend next step. |
| 6 | Diagnostic Scenarios | `#proof-examples` | Показывает anonymized scenarios без неподтверждённых logos, metrics или client identities. |
| 7 | Why Opsfield Systems | `#why-opsfield-systems` | Объединяет differentiation и comparison против tool-first, automation-first и dev-first подходов. |
| 8 | Delivery Model | `#delivery-model` | Показывает senior involvement, роли Managing Partner / Solution Architect и релевантные operating environments. |
| 9 | Business & IT Diagnostic | `#business-it-diagnostic` | Единый conversion cluster: first-step offer, Before You Commit, post-submit steps и форма `#diagnostic-request-form`. |

| 11 | Final CTA | `#final-cta` | Финальный возврат к Business & IT Diagnostic. |

Note: Section 6 "Diagnostic Scenarios" uses anchor #proof-examples and appears as "Results" in navigation. These are intentional aliases: content name, technical anchor, and user-facing navigation label.

## Header — from `texts.md`

| Element | Value | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Logo | Opsfield Systems | `/` |
| Navigation item | Services | `#what-we-diagnose` |
| Navigation item | How It Works | `#how-the-diagnostic-works` |
| Navigation item | Results | `#proof-examples` |
| Navigation item | FAQ | `#faq` |
| Primary CTA | Request Diagnostic | `#diagnostic-request-form` |

### ICP visibility rules

- The homepage must state the primary ICP publicly: B2B companies with 50–250 employees.
- The size range appears in the Hero and in the FAQ answer about company fit.
- Treat 50–250 employees as the strongest fit, not as an automatic rejection rule.
- Do not add `50–250 employees` to the H1, primary CTA, or every section.
- Company Size remains optional in the form and must not block submission.

### Header rules

- Header items must match `texts.md`: Services / How It Works / Results / FAQ.
- Primary CTA must match `texts.md`: `Request Diagnostic`.
- Do not use `Contact Us` as the primary CTA.
- Mobile header uses the same navigation items in a simple drawer.

| Footer | Request Diagnostic | `#diagnostic-request-form` |

### CTA → Request Type Routing

Each CTA targeting #diagnostic-request-form may carry a data attribute: data-request-type="[value]"

On arrival at the form, JavaScript reads the most recent data-request-type and prefills the Request Type select. The prefilled value must remain editable by the user.

If no data attribute is present (direct scroll or generic CTA), Request Type remains empty/default.

**Implementation invariant:** `request_type` is one form field. It may be prefilled from CTA context and remain hidden while the optional block is collapsed; when the block opens, the same value is shown in an editable select. Do not create separate hidden and visible `request_type` inputs.

| CTA text | Prefilled request_type |
|---|---|
| Request a Business & IT Diagnostic | Business & IT Diagnostic |
| Diagnose the Operating Bottleneck | Business & IT Diagnostic |
| Assess Automation Opportunities | AI & Process Automation Review |
| Start With a Diagnostic | (none — generic) |
| Validate the Decision Before You Implement | Business & IT Diagnostic |
| Request a Diagnostic for Your Team | (none — generic) |
| Work With Senior Advisors | (none — generic) |
